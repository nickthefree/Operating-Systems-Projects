-----------END TIME TRIALS-----------------
-----------OBSERVATIONS--------------------
Part 1: This program simply accepts a filename as a parameter and reads the content of the file to completion.
I had some difficulty getting fscanf to function properly; however, the fread function worked flawlessly. The 
time trials on this part were consistently low regardless of file size. 

Part 2: This program accepted the same parameters and performs a similar function as Part 1, with the addition of a user specified buffer size. 
The main general trend here seems to be: the larger the buffer size, the less time the program takes to execute.

Part 3: This program extends from our second program by also writing a file for each read operation. The general trend
between the time trails seems to still be the larger the buffer and the smaller the file, the less time it takes for 
the program to execute. The larger the file or the smaller the buffer, the more time the system takes to process the
program.

Part 4: This program uses multiple threads to create multiple files of a dummy document. This is again similar
to the previous test, with the use of threads and multiple copies being a new functionality. The time trails seem
to be correlated with the number of copies, the size of the buffer, and the size of the file. The total amount of infomation
being written--which would be a factor comprised of the size of the file being copied and the number of copies being writted--seems 
to be the biggest factor. The buffer also correlates with time spent, but to a lesser degree than the aformentioned variables.
