1. Open up your ECC System, and start up the command terminal.
2. In the terminal, type in "$ setup vmware"
	a. This prepares vmware to run. 
3. Next, in the terminal also run the command "minix-get-image"
	a. Get's the image that VMware needs to run off of. Will also erase any previous images, so be careful.
4. Next, run the command "vmware &"
	a. This will take a while. Don't run the command multiple times, wait at least a minute before running the command
 		again if it doesn't work.
5. Open a virtual machine and acess the "vm images" subfolder -> "minix3" folder -> minix3.vmx
6. Use the username "root" to login and create a password by using the "passwd" command.
	a. Be careful here, as the system won't allow you to see the characters you are typing.
7. Use the command "tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &" to allow you to utilize FTP within your lunix command window.
	a. This command let's you link your virtual machine to your host machine using FTP
8. The command "ifconfig" within your VM will let you see the IP you need to connect to.
9. Using this IP you can use your lunix terminal to type in "ftp (ip address of VM's ifconfig)"
10. The following FTP commands will prove useful:

	ls
 		 - show contents of remote directory 
	pwd
		 - show current location in VM 
	cd
		 - change directory on the VM 
For Local Navigation 
	lcd
 		- show current location on host machine 
	lcd <directory>
 		- change location to <directory> 
File Transfer 
	get <file>
 		- copy <file> from current location in VM to current location on host. 
	put <file>
 		- copy <file> from current location on host to current location in VM. 
11. You are looking for a "main.c" file within the /usr/src directory.
	a. In order to find this file, I would reccomend learning to utilize the "grep" command within your virtual 		machine. Navagating to /usr/src and searching using the "grep" command will tell you where you need to find "main.c"
12. Once this file is found, modify it in your lunix machine to edit the starting message.
	a. This is quite trivial
13. Navagate to the /usr/src/kernel withing your VM. Now using your FTP commands in your Lunix terminal, use the 	 		"put" command listed above to overwrite the "main.c" within your VM.
	a. Note: using the "put" command will automatically overwrite files with the same name, if one exists within the 		current directory.
14. Now go back to your VM and navigate back to /usr/src.
15. In the VM type in "make world" to rebuild your VM.
16. Reboot to ensure that your new message is printed on startup of your VM. 
	a. If the default message is still printed, I reccomend creating a new image and repeating the steps listed 		above.
