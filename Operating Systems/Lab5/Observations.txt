Part 1:
-This program intruduces the concept of semaphores by creating threads that utilize mutual exclusion in order 
to prevent desyncronization. 

Part 2:
-This program utilizes semaphores in order to solve the consumer/producer problem. Using mutual exclusion only
one entity will have access to the buffer at a time. Producers place items in the buffer and consumers read from
the buffer. Consumers consume from the buffer unless it is empty, in which case a signal is passed to the producers and
they are allowed to begin producing again. If the buffer is full producers signal to the consumers and consumers
begin consuming from the buffer once again. Producers are allowed to produce before the buffer is full again,
but this is mostly random and determined by the PCB.
